    "Last weekend, my father beat the FUCK out of me. I came home 45 minutes late, and ignored him when he tried to talk to me because i was too tired to argue and i let him know that...when i opened the fridge, he slammed it shut and said that \"ungrateful shits\" like me don\u0027t deserve food from \"his\" fridge. I ignored him and told him that i\u0027m too tired to argue, and went to bed. 20 minutes later, he barged in, screaming, hysterical. He grabbed me by my throat, choked me, slammed me against the wall, kneed me a couple of times while screaming \"WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, PUSSY?!!?!?\" After doing so, he threw me across the room, where I slammed my head against the wall...He ran across the room and smashed my head several times against the ground, hitting me across the arms and back. He kicked me out after that, and while i\u0027m home now, our relationship is pretty much broken...I feel totally helpless in this situation. I UNDERSTAND. I SHOULD call CPS/911. But that isn\u0027t an option right now...the bruises have faded, he\u0027s trying to mend the relationship, and it would be uncalled for me to report him now. All i can do is move forward.",
    "Anime is poison to children\u0027s minds and it creates a fake world for them to live in. Anime introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very graphic and violent scenes. This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day. Anime also consumes your soul and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes of fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The people who watch anime are not the problem, anime is. Anime is the root of all problems, cancer, war, Africa, and the Nazis. Since people watch anime on the TV so much, it uses electricity and is the reason why the oil reserves will run out soon. Anime causes cancer because it has been proven TV screens emit radiation and radiation causes cancer. Anime has caused war by inspiring the Nazis to side with the Japanese through their cartoons and establishing the Pacific Front in World War 2. African leaders in Africa are corrupted by anime influences and they cannot tend to their peoples needs and cannot feed them. Future generations will be ruined and destroyed by anime influence. Everyone thinks the downfall of humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is anime. After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted to get their revenge on the world and created their ultimate weapon, anime.",

    "My 12 Year old asked me for a $25 gift card for Play Station Network for her birthday and when I went to put in my password for her to download a game there it was, Satan Universe Attack the Lords light!!! Needless to say I said absolutely not and then made her buy a Scooby Doo movie for $5 so she couldnt buy the game, she said god was fake and that Jesus was black, no doubt this idea came from Steven Universe itself!!! ~Esther"
